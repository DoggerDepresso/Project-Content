# Project-Content
This is for all Project related content for the Arduino/Raspberry Pi.

For Robot_Code_2:
  NOTE: General Schemetic Not Included. Only General Explanation.
  This program is for the Arduino Robot which utilizes 2 IR Proximity Sensors, 2 DC Motors, an Arduino, L298N H-Bridge Motor Controller, 9V Battery & Connector,
  4xAA Batteries & Battery Housing, and other features. Every line of code should be fairly detailed to the point where it's not too difficult to understand. It's
  subject to change in case of any additional components that increase the robots' functionality and variety.
